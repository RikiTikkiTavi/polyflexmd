	abstract = {The recognition of vesicles by their correct target compartment depends on the pairing of small GTPases with effector proteins (1{\textendash}3). Whereas ATPases can cyclically convert the free energy of ATP hydrolysis into mechanical work, the function of small GTPases is predominantly associated with signal transduction processes, and their role in mechano-transduction is less established (4{\textendash}6). However, binding of the GTPase Rab5 to the long coiled-coil tethering protein EEA1 on an early endosome induces a rigidity transition resulting in a large conformational change in EEA1 from a rigid and extended to a flexible and collapsed state. This entropic collapse of EEA1 gives rise to an effective force that can pull tethered membranes closer (7). It currently remains unclear if EEA1 can return from the collapsed to the extended conformation without the aid of chaperones. Here, we use fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to reveal that EEA1 in bulk solution can undergo multiple flexibility transition cycles that are associated with the binding and release of Rab5(GTP) and Rab5(GDP). Using semi-flexible polymer theory we provide evidence that the cyclic transitioning of Rab5-EEA1 between extended and collapsed conformations is driven by the energetics of Rab5 binding/unbinding and GTP hydrolysis. Cyclic flexibility transitions represent a complete mechanical work cycle that is able to perform up to 20 kBT of mechanical work per cycle, against an opposing force. Hence, Rab5 and EEA1 constitute a two-component molecular motor driven by the chemical energy derived from GTP hydrolysis by Rab5. We conclude that coiled-coil tethering proteins and their small GTPase partners can have active mechanical roles in membrane trafficking.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

The method is based on Hill’s formal theory of physical clusters. In the method, a molecular dynamics calculation is used to calculate the average potential energy of a cluster of molecules as a function of temperature, and the equilibrium constants are calculated from the integral of the energy with respect to reciprocal temperature. The method is illustrated by calculations of the equilibrium constants for the formation of clusters of two to five water molecules that interact with each other by an intermolecular potential devised by Watts. The method is compared with other procedures for calculating the thermodynamic properties of clusters.}",

The Rouse model provides an excellent description for short chains N\\&lt;Ne, while the dynamics of the long chains can be described by the reptation model. By mapping the model chains onto chemical species we give estimates of the times and distances of onset of the slowing down in motion due to reptation. Comparison to neutron spin‐echo data confirm our mapping procedure, resolving a discrepancy between various experiments. By considering the primitive chain we are able to directly visualize the confinement to a tube. Analyzing the Rouse mode relaxation allows us to exclude the generalized Rouse models, while the original reptation prediction gives a good description of the data.}",

    abstract = { We point out that in a Brownian dynamics simulation it is justified to use arbitrary distribution functions of random numbers if the moments exhibit the correct limiting behavior prescribed by the Fokker-Planck equation. Our argument is supported by a simple analytical consideration and some numerical examples: We simulate the Wiener process, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and the diffusion in a Φ4 potential, using both Gaussian and uniform random numbers. In these examples, the rate of convergence of the mean first exit time is found to be nearly identical for both types of random numbers. }

While in the limit of fully flexible chains the visibility of the anomalous diffusion behavior is thus rather restricted, the t3/4 power law predicted for stiff chains without hydrodynamic interactions is verified. Including hydrodynamics, evidence for the predicted [tln(t)]3/4 behavior is obtained. Similar good agreement with previous theoretical predictions is found for the decay of the bond autocorrelation functions and the end-to-end vector correlation. Finally, several predictions on the variation of characteristic relaxation times with persistence length describing the chain stiffness are tested.}",

abstract = {We present a mean-field dynamical theory for single semiflexible polymers which can precisely capture, without fitting parameters, recent fluorescence correlation spectroscopy results on single-monomer kinetics of DNA strands in solution. Our approach works globally, covering three decades of strand length and five decades of time: it includes the complex cross-overs occurring between stiffness-dominated and flexible bending modes, along with larger-scale rotational and center-of-mass motion. The accuracy of the theory stems in part from long-range hydrodynamic coupling between the monomers, which makes a mean-field description more realistic. Its validity extends even to short, stiff fragments, where we also test the theory through Brownian hydrodynamics simulations.}
